# What

Here I'll show a few -hopefully- useful scripts and utilities for
building Python development environments with ease.

## How

In a few steps I'll build a nice environment management in general and
specific environments to go with different Python versions, packages
or even projects.

## What the hell for?

## Requirements

* Python (obviously)
* easy_install
* virtualenv

### Python

On modern systems you'll have at least two Python versions: 2.5 and 2.6,
but older ones are to go as well.

### easy_install

We'll use this to grab the necessary packages for the next steps and
forget it immediately. If you don't have easy_install, download setuptools
from PyPI http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools and install it the normal
way with 
    python setup.py install
after unpacking.

### virtualenv

We'll use virtualenv for its coolness extensively, so after you went along
with easy_install, do an 
    easy_install virtualenv
